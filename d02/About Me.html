<h1>All About Me!</h1>

<h2>What's My Name?</h2>
<p>Francis Adu</p>

<h2>Where Are You From?</h2>
<p>The border of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties in New Jersey. My family originates from the West African country of Ghana.</p> <img src="http://www.meteo.gov.gh/website/images/stories/ghana_flag_map.jpg">

<h2>What Do You Do?</h2>
<p>Primarily just a student. I also write about prospects hoping to join the NBA at <a href="http://www.ridiculousupside.com">Ridiculous Upside</a>.

<h2>Is Basketball A Passion of Yours?</h2>
<p>Yeah, I was basically hooked the night I saw Space Jam as a toddler. But I enjoy basically all sports.</p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Space_jam.jpg">

<h2>If I Wanted to Start Getting Into Basketball, Where Should I Start?</h2>
<p>Try <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com">Basketball-Reference</a>. It's a good source of the history of the NBA. And, of course, actually watch the games! </br> The NBA season runs from the last week of October to the month of June and games are available to watch </br> almost every day of the week.</p>

<h2>What Else Do You Like?</h2>
<p>Mostly scour the internet to learn as much as possible. </br> Often via Wikipedia wormholes like this, </br> for example: <a href="./Did You Know?.html">Did You Know?</a></p>
