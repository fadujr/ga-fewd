	<h1> Did You Know? </h1>
	<p>The prolific actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> broke out in the cult classic film Pulp Fiction but that happened well after Jackson involved himself in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Jackson would get arrested and convicted of unlawful confinement after being one of a group of black students who held the Morehouse College board of trustees hostage in exchange for college reform...</p> <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/df/f6/c4/dff6c44c37a7e7445ae0fa9d8056832a.jpg">

	<p>...Of course, Morehouse College is the famous all-male HBCU residing in Atlanta, Georgia. The college's fame on a more mainstream level is rooted in being the alma mater of Civil Rights hero <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, one of the most influential Americans in the country's history...</p> <img src="http://cdn.pinknews.co.uk/images/2015/09/mlk.jpg">

	<p>...Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s legacy of activism for human rights has affected the United States so deeply that a bill to commemorate King's birthday of January 15th as a national holiday was introduced to Congress by two black Congressmen, Rep. John Conyers (Mi.) and Sen. Edward Brooke (Ma.), in 1971. Yet the bill wouldn't be voted on by the House of Representatives until eight years later and that vote initially rejected the bill due to the potential expenses of a scheduled paid vacation day and King's stature being seen as less significant than George Washington and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>...</p> <img src= "http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/02/columbus-day-H.jpeg">

	<p>...Ironically, Christopher Columbus's claim to fame as the discoverer of the land that will be the United States of America is tenuous at best. For one, Columbus never arrived on mainland North America but instead landed on the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> (today, Dominican Republic and Haiti). Also, Columbus's arrival to the Americas not only was preceded by Leif Erikson's exploration of Newfoundland in current Canada, four hundred years before Columbus, but naturally the native inhabitants of the Carribbean and the Americas as well. Columbus even mistakenly believed he actually arrived the East Indies of Asia, the true goal of his crossatlantic voyage, not the soon-to-be-dubbed Hispaniola.</p> <img src="https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/09/5109-004-5335E25D.jpg">
